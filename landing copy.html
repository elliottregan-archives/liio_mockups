            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>The fundamental concept behind Liio is belief that small changes, repeated over time or by many individuals, can “snowball” to produce dramatic results. Together, through a partnership with PLS (an Executive Coaching & Leadership Development firm based in Syracuse, NY) we created Liio to apply this concept and change “what’s possible” for individuals and organizations interested in growing and developing their most valuable asset, Human Capital.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Join the Liio Project</h3>

Our SPARK process can be applied to any number of strategies or content areas where your people need the most support, and our custom-built platform focuses on efficiency, transparency, and most importantly taking action to achieve results.</p>
