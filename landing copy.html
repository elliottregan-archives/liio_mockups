      		<p>We understand that your email contains personal and potentially sensitive information and, therefore, we take precaution to ensure that it is stored securely while on our servers.  It is our promise that we will always respect your privacy.  Mozzomail uses the OpenID and OAuth protocols for Gmail authentication and access. We will never have access to or the ability to store your Gmail password. We analyze your emails only for the purpose of organizing your links, documents and media and only store meta information (e.g. document and link identifiers, sender, recipient, date and keywords), as well as, anonymous analytics that help us to continually improve Mozzomail and present you with the most relevant information.  Original emails are deleted post-processing and are not stored on our servers. <br> <a href="#">Read our privacy policy.</a></p>

      		<h3 id="email">Why use it?</h3>
      		<p>Email remains the collaborative tool of choice. It is full of personally actionable information that you regularly need to locate and send.  The most important information, however, quickly becomes buried in the depths of your inbox and sent mail. Our data suggests that of all the people you cross paths with via email, you only really communicate with around 12% of them.  Furthermore, 50% of your email is exchanged with this 12%!  Mozzomail analyzes your email behavior (with whom you communicate and what you talk about) and based on this analysis, presents you with the links, documents and media that are most relevant to you.<br>
